# SpeechSegmentation
Speech signal segmentation algorithm I did for my master's thesis using python 2.7 and scipy. Some desciption is available in description.odt, but it is in russian.

To test, put some wav files in "sound_dir" folder specified in config.py, run "run.py", then open analysed wav in audacity and import labels which will be created in {wavfilename}_segments.txt in "sound_dir".
